# Cloud Computing

## Compute Types

1. Compute
2. Container
3. Serviceless

## Choosing a Compute Option

1. When you have compute-intensive or memory-intensive application

- EC2 provide consistent and predictable amount of CPU.
- You can access underlying files.
- EC2 work with other Services
- EC2 for long-running, stateful application.
- type, size or storage.
- optimized for use cases.
- versatile and reliable.
- pay for what you use.

2. Considerations for containers

- small application runs under 15 minutes but compute intensive.
- large monolithic application.
- no need persistent data storage.
- no need complex networking, routing, or security requirement.

3. Consideration of Serverless

- building, testing and deploying a lot and want to focus on code.
- less compute intensive.
- small, simple, or modular.
- one serivce call another service.
- run less than 15 minutes.
